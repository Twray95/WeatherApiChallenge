# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard was made to show the current weather and the 5 day forecast for any city searched by the user and allow the user to go back to their recent city searches.

## Usage

The user can type a city name into the search box and either click enter or the "Search a City!" button underneath the searchbox to display the weather for today and the 5 day forecast of that city. A button is automatically generated below the search form with names of cities the user has searched. The user can click on these buttons to re-display the weather and forecast for the city the button is linked to. These past search buttons will persist through a page refresh because they are pulled from local storage.
